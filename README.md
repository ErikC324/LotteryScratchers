# LotteryScratchers
Web-scraper for scratch-off lottery tickets to calculate their current expect values. Currently implemented for the South Carolina Education Lottery, but will expand to other state lotteries that also publicly provide the distribution of remaining prizes for each game.

# Motivation
I wanted to know exactly what the expected value of scratch-off games were, if they differed by price level, and if it would be possible for a disproportionate amount of large prizes remaining could create a ticket with a positive expected value.
